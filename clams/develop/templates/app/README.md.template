1. `requirements.txt` to specify python dependencies
1. `Containerfile` to containerize the app and specify system dependencies
1. `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files listing commonly ignored files
1. an empty `LICENSE` file to replace with an actual license information of the app
1. `CLAMS-generic-readme.md` file with basic instructions of app installation and execution
1. This `README.md` file for additional information not specified in the generic readme file. 
1. A number of GitHub Actions workflows for issue/bug-report management 
1. A GHA workflow to publish app images upon any push of a git tag
   * **NOTE**: All GHA workflows included are designed to only work in repositories under `clamsproject` organization.
