This skeleton code is a scaffolding for Python-based CLAMS app development. Specifically, it contains 

1. `app.py` and `metadata.py` to write the app 
1. `requirements.txt` to specify python dependencies
1. `.gitignore` file listing common ignored files
1. `Containerfile` to containerize the app and specify system dependencies
1. an empty `LICENSE` file to replace with an actual license information of the app
1. `CLAMS-generic-readme.md` file with basic instructions of app installation and execution
1. This `README.md` file for additional information not specified in the generic readme file. 
1. (optional) some GH actions workflow for issue/bug-report management
1. (optional) a GH actions workflow to build and upload app images upon any push of a git tag

Use the following section to document any additional information specific to this app. If your app works significantly 
different from what's described in the generic readme file, be as specific as possible.
